# SimCity 64 Korean Fan Translation

Translation by WindowsTiger

I all rewrite PeterLemon's bass assmbler code to kingstone assembler code.

Thanks to ozidual, I can use VWF hack(0.50's one, maybe)
Becuase ozidual's original converted 0x2020 to tab, although there is kanji between two 0x20, so I took hard time to remove it.

Howto Compile:
Disk Version: You will need the original Japanese disk image in .ndd (Big-Endian) Format, in the root directory of this patch
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.ndd) file.
Using armips Run: make.bat

Cart Version: You will need the Zoinkity Japanese cart ROM in .n64 (Big-Endian) Format, in the root directory of this patch
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.n64) file.
Using rmips Run: maket.bat
